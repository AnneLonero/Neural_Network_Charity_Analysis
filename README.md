# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is analyzing the dataset containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup (a philanthopic non-profit organization) over the years to identify impact of each donation and vet the potential recipients. We used deep-learning neural networks with TensorFlow and Python to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.

The following methods were also used in the analysis:
* Preprocess data for neural network model
* Compile, train and evaluate the model
* Optimize the model for higher accuracy

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
* Column ==IS_SUCCESSFUL== is considered as target for our deep learning neural network. This column cointains binary data indicates whether or not the charity donation was used effectively.
